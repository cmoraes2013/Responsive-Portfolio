              <p>Hello! Or as they say it in my native language Portuguese, Oi!  Before I tell you about me, let me tell you little bit about you! You're here reading this today to get to know a small fragment of my personality and to also evaluate my coding abilities. I wish us both good luck! I am 24 years old and I was born in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; at the age of 5 my parents relocated our family to Orlando, the city beautiful. My first job was at CiCi's Pizza when I was 14 and that was the start of a lucrative career in food service, bartending and hospitality. Immediately after graduating high school I went on to earn my Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Florida State University. It took me 5 years instead of 4, but better late than never! Upon graduating about a year and half ago, I found a job as a Customer Service Representative for an online car buying company. I quickly moved up to a Sales position and then became Manager of the customer service team. I hold closely to my heart the belief that anyone can accomplish what they desire if they have strong ambitions. The technology/coding industry peaked my interest in the last position that I held. My former company's CEO had a background in web development and I purchased cars all over the nation with the help of their unique software. I decided to quit my job and immerse myself in learning a skill that is completely unfamiliar to me and in much demand for competent workers, so here I am ready to take on the challenge! </p>

             <p>The person who motivates me the most, and surely many others, is my mom. Her journey of uprooting her entire life to move to a different country while supporting 3 kids inspires my every decision. I work to be able to repay her for all her sacrifices and to express my gratitude. My dog Jefferson is another being who keeps me determined. He is 110lbs of meaty, lovable red-nose Pitbull and rescuing him was the best choice I ever made! I'd like to wrap this up by mentioning a few hobbies that keep me sane. I enjoy mediating, playing ping-pong [challenge me if you dare], cleaning [weird..I know], water color, and spending time with nature. If only I could combine doing all those things at once, it'd be pure euphoria!
